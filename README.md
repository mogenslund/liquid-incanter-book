# Liquid Incanter Book

This as a sample project to show how Liquid can be used to integrate with other projects, in this case the statistics and plotting library [Incanter](https://github.com/incanter/incanter)

Just clone this project and run:

    lein liq

(requires leiningen)

This will start Liquid with Incanter import. The first page is an interactive guide. Have fun!
